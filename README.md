# jq-repair-script

This repository contains a Bash script named `fix_jq_install.sh` that repairs [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. The script addresses issues related to missing newlines in package list files that can cause installation or functionality problems with `jq`.

## Features

- Checks if `jq` is installed and functioning properly.
- Attempts to repair `jq` if it is not working.
- Detects and fixes the "missing final newline" error in package list files.
- Automatically retries repair after applying fixes.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- A Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
- Administrative privileges (you need to run the script as `root` or using `sudo`).

### Steps

1. **Download the Script**

   Download the `fix_jq_install.sh` script from this repository.

2. **Make the Script Executable**

       chmod +x fix_jq_install.sh

3. **Run the Script**

       sudo ./fix_jq_install.sh

   **Note**: It's important to run the script with `sudo` to ensure it has the necessary permissions.

## Script Details

The script performs the following actions:

- Checks if `jq` is installed and operational.
